# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The Othello iOS app follows a clean MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture with clear separation of concerns and testability as primary goals.

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Models**: Pure data structures with no business logic
- **ViewModels**: Business logic and state management
- **Views**: UI representation with minimal logic
- **Services**: External dependencies and complex operations

### 2. Dependency Injection
- Protocol-based service interfaces
- Constructor injection for dependencies
- Testable architecture through mocking

### 3. Reactive Programming
- SwiftUI's `@Published` and `@State` for reactive updates
- Combine framework for complex data flows
- Unidirectional data flow

## Layer Breakdown

### Models Layer
```swift
// Pure value types representing game concepts
struct GameState {
    let board: Board
    let currentPlayer: Player
    let gamePhase: GamePhase
    let score: Score
}

struct Board {
    private var cells: [[CellState]]
    // Immutable interface with functional updates
}
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Data representation
- Value semantics
- Validation of data integrity
- Codable conformance for persistence

### ViewModels Layer
```swift
@MainActor
final class GameViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published private(set) var gameState: GameState
    
    private let gameEngine: GameEngineProtocol
    private let aiService: AIServiceProtocol
}
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Business logic coordination
- State management
- User action handling
- Service orchestration

### Views Layer
```swift
struct GameView: View {
    @StateObject private var viewModel: GameViewModel
    
    var body: some View {
        // Declarative UI with accessibility
    }
}
```

**Responsibilities:**
- UI presentation
- User interaction handling
- Accessibility implementation
- Visual feedback and animations

### Services Layer
```swift
protocol GameEngineProtocol {
    func isValidMove(_ move: Move, in gameState: GameState) -> Bool
    func applyMove(_ move: Move, to gameState: GameState) -> GameState
    func availableMoves(for gameState: GameState) -> [Move]
}
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Game rules implementation
- AI algorithms
- Persistence operations
- External API communication (future)

## Data Flow

### User Action Flow
1. User interacts with View
2. View calls ViewModel method
3. ViewModel validates action
4. ViewModel calls appropriate Service
5. Service returns result
6. ViewModel updates published state
7. View automatically re-renders

### AI Move Flow
1. ViewModel detects AI turn
2. ViewModel calls AIService
3. AIService analyzes game state
4. AIService returns selected move
5. ViewModel applies move through GameEngine
6. ViewModel updates game state
7. View reflects new state

## State Management

### Game State Architecture
```swift
struct GameState {
    let board: Board
    let currentPlayer: Player
    let availableMoves: [Move]
    let score: Score
    let gamePhase: GamePhase
    
    // Computed properties for derived state
    var isGameOver: Bool { /* ... */ }
    var winner: Player? { /* ... */ }
}
```

### State Transitions
- Immutable state objects
- Functional updates return new instances
- Clear state transition points
- Predictable state changes

## AI Architecture

### Difficulty Levels
```swift
enum AIDifficulty: CaseIterable {
    case easy    // Random valid moves
    case medium  // Basic minimax (depth 3)
    case hard    // Advanced minimax with alpha-beta pruning (depth 6)
}
```

### AI Service Design
```swift
protocol AIServiceProtocol {
    func selectMove(for gameState: GameState, difficulty: AIDifficulty) async -> Move?
}

final class AIService: AIServiceProtocol {
    func selectMove(for gameState: GameState, difficulty: AIDifficulty) async -> Move? {
        switch difficulty {
        case .easy: return randomMove(for: gameState)
        case .medium: return minimaxMove(for: gameState, depth: 3)
        case .hard: return alphaBetaMove(for: gameState, depth: 6)
        }
    }
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Models: Test data integrity and computed properties
- ViewModels: Test business logic and state transitions
- Services: Test algorithms and external interactions

### Integration Testing
- ViewModel + Service integration
- Complete game flow testing
- AI decision validation

### UI Testing
- Accessibility compliance
- User interaction flows
- Visual regression testing

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- Value types for models prevent retain cycles
- Weak references in closures
- Proper lifecycle management for ViewModels

### Computational Efficiency
- Async AI calculations to prevent UI blocking
- Lazy loading of complex calculations
- Efficient board representation

### UI Performance
- Minimal view updates through proper state management
- Efficient SwiftUI view hierarchies
- Animation performance optimization

## Accessibility Architecture

### Built-in Accessibility
```swift
struct CellView: View {
    let position: BoardPosition
    let state: CellState
    
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .accessibilityLabel(accessibilityDescription)
            .accessibilityHint("Double tap to place piece")
            .accessibilityAddTraits(state == .empty ? .isButton : .isStaticText)
    }
    
    private var accessibilityDescription: String {
        "\(position.description), \(state.description)"
    }
}
```

### Accessibility Services
- Dedicated accessibility announcement service
- Dynamic Type support throughout
- VoiceOver navigation optimization
- High contrast mode support

## Future Extensibility

### Multiplayer Preparation
- Network service protocol definitions
- Game state serialization
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Offline mode handling

### Game Center Integration
- Achievement tracking hooks
- Leaderboard data structures
- Player matching interfaces
- Turn-based game protocols

### Customization Support
- Theme system architecture
- Pluggable rule variations
- Configurable AI personalities
- User preference management

## Error Handling

### Error Types
```swift
enum GameError: LocalizedError {
    case invalidMove(Move)
    case gameAlreadyEnded
    case aiCalculationFailed
    
    var errorDescription: String? {
        // User-friendly error messages
    }
}
```

### Error Propagation
- Service errors bubble up through Result types
- ViewModels handle and present errors appropriately
- User-friendly error messaging
- Graceful degradation for non-critical failures

## Security Considerations

### Data Validation
- Input sanitization at service boundaries
- Move validation on multiple levels
- State consistency checks

### Future Network Security
- API authentication preparation
- Data encryption for multiplayer
- Anti-cheating measures
- Privacy protection protocols
