# Othello

A modern, accessible implementation of the classic Othello (Reversi) board game built with SwiftUI and Swift Testing. Currently available for macOS with iOS adaptation ready.

## Features

- **Human vs Human**: Local multiplayer with clear turn indicators
- **AI Opponents**: Three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- **Accessibility First**: Full VoiceOver support, Dynamic Type, high contrast
- **Modern iOS**: Built for iOS 18 with SwiftUI and Swift Testing
- **Future Ready**: Prepared for Game Center and multiplayer sharing

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0+ (current implementation)
- iOS 18.0+ (planned)
- Xcode 16.0+
- Swift 6.0+

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `Othello/Othello.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Build and run on macOS

## Game Rules

Othello is played on an 8x8 board with black and white discs. Players take turns placing discs to capture opponent pieces by flanking them. The player with the most discs when no more moves are possible wins.

## Architecture

This app follows MVVM + Clean Architecture principles:

- **Models**: Game state, board representation, player management
- **ViewModels**: Business logic and state management  
- **Views**: SwiftUI components with built-in accessibility
- **Services**: AI engine, game rules, persistence

## Testing

Run tests with `âŒ˜+U` in Xcode or:

```bash
xcodebuild test -project Othello/Othello.xcodeproj -scheme Othello -destination 'platform=macOS'
```

## Current Status

âœ… **Phase 5 Complete**: Advanced AI implementation with 3-tier difficulty system  
ðŸŽ¯ **Next**: iOS adaptation and App Store deployment  
ðŸ“‹ **Future**: Full Apple ecosystem expansion (iPadOS, tvOS, watchOS)
