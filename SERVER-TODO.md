# Server-Side Features TODO

This document tracks future server-side features to be implemented in a separate repository for multiplayer and social functionality.

## High Priority

### Real-Time Multiplayer
- [ ] WebSocket-based game synchronization
- [ ] Game room creation and joining
- [ ] Turn-based move validation and broadcasting
- [ ] Reconnection handling for dropped connections
- [ ] Game state persistence across sessions

### Authentication & User Management
- [ ] Sign in with Apple integration
- [ ] User profile creation and management
- [ ] Friend system and friend requests
- [ ] Privacy settings and blocking functionality

### Game Invitations
- [ ] Deep link generation for game invites
- [ ] Share link creation with game parameters
- [ ] Invitation acceptance/decline flow
- [ ] Push notifications for game invites

## Medium Priority

### Game Center Integration
- [ ] Leaderboard synchronization
- [ ] Achievement tracking and unlocking
- [ ] Player matchmaking based on skill level
- [ ] Turn-based game integration APIs

### Statistics & Analytics
- [ ] Game history tracking
- [ ] Win/loss statistics per player
- [ ] AI difficulty performance metrics
- [ ] Move analysis and game insights

### Social Features
- [ ] Spectator mode for ongoing games
- [ ] Game replay sharing
- [ ] Chat system during games
- [ ] Tournament creation and management

## Low Priority

### Advanced Features
- [ ] AI training data collection
- [ ] Custom board themes and piece designs
- [ ] Time-limited games with move timers
- [ ] Rating system (ELO-based)

### Monetization (Future Consideration)
- [ ] Premium themes and customizations
- [ ] Advanced AI difficulty levels
- [ ] Tournament entry fees
- [ ] Remove ads subscription

## Technical Requirements

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Scalable WebSocket server (Node.js/Socket.io or Go)
- [ ] Redis for session management and caching
- [ ] PostgreSQL for persistent data storage
- [ ] JWT-based authentication system
- [ ] Rate limiting and abuse prevention

### Security
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] DDoS protection
- [ ] Encrypted data transmission
- [ ] Privacy compliance (GDPR, CCPA)

### Performance
- [ ] Horizontal scaling capabilities
- [ ] CDN for static assets
- [ ] Database query optimization
- [ ] Caching strategies for frequent data
- [ ] Load balancing for high availability

## API Design Considerations

### RESTful Endpoints
```
POST /api/v1/games - Create new game
GET /api/v1/games/{id} - Get game state
POST /api/v1/games/{id}/moves - Submit move
GET /api/v1/users/{id}/stats - Get player statistics
POST /api/v1/invites - Send game invitation
```

### WebSocket Events
```
game:join - Join game room
game:move - Submit move
game:state - Receive game state update
game:ended - Game completion notification
```

### Data Models
- User profile with preferences
- Game state with board position
- Move history with timestamps
- Player statistics and rankings
- Friend relationships and status

## Implementation Timeline

**Phase 1** (Months 1-2): Basic multiplayer infrastructure
**Phase 2** (Months 3-4): Authentication and user management
**Phase 3** (Months 5-6): Social features and Game Center
**Phase 4** (Months 7+): Advanced features and optimization

## Dependencies

### Client-Side Changes Required
- [ ] Network service layer for API communication
- [ ] WebSocket client implementation
- [ ] Deep linking handler for invitations
- [ ] Offline/online mode detection
- [ ] Sync conflict resolution

### Third-Party Services
- [ ] Apple Sign In integration
- [ ] Push notification service (APNs)
- [ ] Analytics platform (Firebase/Mixpanel)
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry/Bugsnag)
- [ ] Performance monitoring

## Security Considerations

### Anti-Cheating
- [ ] Server-side move validation
- [ ] Game state verification
- [ ] Unusual play pattern detection
- [ ] Time-based move validation

### Privacy
- [ ] Minimal data collection
- [ ] User consent management
- [ ] Data retention policies
- [ ] Right to deletion implementation
