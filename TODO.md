## Technical Debt & Workarounds

### Medium Priority - Xcode Test Scheme Configuration
- **Status**: Active Workaround
- **Temporary Fix**: Pre-commit hook builds test targets individually instead of running full test suite
- **Proper Solution**: Configure Xcode scheme to include OthelloTests target in Test action
- **Impact**: Tests must be run manually; automated test execution in CI/hooks is limited
- **Files**: 
  - `.git/hooks/pre-commit` (contains workaround)
  - `Othello/Othello.xcodeproj/xcshareddata/xcschemes/` (needs proper scheme configuration)
- **Steps to Fix**:
  1. Open project in Xcode
  2. Edit "Othello" scheme
  3. Add OthelloTests target to Test action
  4. Make scheme shared (move to xcshareddata)
  5. Update pre-commit hook to use `xcodebuild test -scheme Othello`

## Notes for AI Agents

- **Update Frequency**: This TODO list should be updated whenever priorities change or new tasks are identified
- **Task Granularity**: Break down large tasks into smaller, actionable items
- **Dependencies**: Consider task dependencies when planning execution order
- **Quality Gates**: Each phase must meet quality criteria before proceeding
- **Workaround Tracking**: Always add temporary fixes to Technical Debt section above
- **Flexibility**: Adjust plan based on discoveries during implementation
