# Contributing to Othello iOS

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Othello iOS! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Development Workflow

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 15.0+ with iOS 17+ SDK
- Swift 5.9+
- SwiftLint (install with `brew install swiftlint`)
- Git with configured user name and email

### Getting Started

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/othello-ios.git
   cd othello-ios
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Install dependencies and verify setup**
   ```bash
   swift build
   swift test
   ```

### Development Guidelines

Please read our comprehensive development guidelines:

- **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** - AI agent development guidelines and coding standards
- **[QUALITY-EXCELLENCE.md](QUALITY-EXCELLENCE.md)** - Quality framework and standards
- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](Documentation/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Technical architecture decisions
- **[TESTING.md](Documentation/TESTING.md)** - Testing strategies and conventions
- **[ACCESSIBILITY.md](Documentation/ACCESSIBILITY.md)** - Accessibility requirements

### Code Standards

#### Swift Style
- Follow Apple's Swift API Design Guidelines
- Use SwiftLint configuration (`.swiftlint.yml`)
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Prefer explicit types in public APIs
- Use meaningful variable and function names

#### Architecture
- Strict MVVM separation
- Models as immutable value types
- ViewModels as `@MainActor` `ObservableObject` classes
- Protocol-based services for testability

#### Testing Requirements
- **Minimum 90% code coverage** for all new code
- All public functions must have corresponding tests
- Use Swift Testing framework (not XCTest)
- Critical game logic requires 100% coverage

### Commit Message Format

We use [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

#### Types
- `feat` - A new feature
- `fix` - A bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation only changes
- `style` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor` - Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `test` - Adding or correcting tests
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks
- `ci` - CI/CD changes
- `perf` - Performance improvements
- `build` - Build system changes

#### Examples
```bash
feat: add AI difficulty selection
fix(board): correct piece capture logic
docs: update README with setup instructions
test: add comprehensive board validation tests
```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure your branch is up to date**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout your-feature-branch
   git rebase main
   ```

2. **Run all quality checks**
   ```bash
   swift build
   swift test
   swiftlint lint
   ```

3. **Create a pull request**
   - Use a descriptive title following conventional commit format
   - Fill out the PR template completely
   - Link any related issues
   - Add screenshots for UI changes
   - Ensure all CI checks pass

4. **Code Review Process**
   - At least one approving review required
   - All conversations must be resolved
   - CI/CD pipeline must pass
   - Documentation must be updated for API changes

### Pre-commit Hooks

The repository includes pre-commit hooks that will run automatically:

- **Build verification** - Ensures code compiles
- **Test execution** - All tests must pass
- **SwiftLint** - Code style validation
- **Common issue detection** - Checks for TODO/FIXME, debug prints, etc.

### CI/CD Pipeline

Our GitHub Actions pipeline includes:

- **Swift build and test** on multiple Xcode versions
- **SwiftLint** code style checking
- **Code coverage** reporting
- **Security scanning** (planned)
- **Performance benchmarks** (planned)
- **Automated releases** based on conventional commits

### Accessibility Requirements

All UI changes must meet accessibility standards:

- VoiceOver support with proper labels and hints
- Dynamic Type support
- High contrast mode compatibility
- Minimum touch target sizes (44x44 points)
- Keyboard navigation support

See [ACCESSIBILITY.md](Documentation/ACCESSIBILITY.md) for detailed requirements.

### Performance Standards

- App launch time: < 2 seconds
- AI move calculation: < 5 seconds (hard difficulty)
- Memory usage: < 150MB
- 60fps during gameplay
- Crash-free rate: > 99.9%

### Documentation Requirements

- All public APIs must have documentation comments
- Update relevant markdown files for architectural changes
- Include usage examples for complex APIs
- Update README for feature additions

### Issue Reporting

When reporting bugs:

1. **Search existing issues** first
2. **Use the issue template**
3. **Provide minimal reproduction steps**
4. **Include device/OS information**
5. **Add relevant logs or screenshots**

### Feature Requests

For new features:

1. **Check the roadmap** ([TODO.md](TODO.md) and [SERVER-TODO.md](SERVER-TODO.md))
2. **Open a discussion** first for major features
3. **Provide clear use cases**
4. **Consider accessibility implications**
5. **Think about testing requirements**

### Security

- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Follow secure coding practices
- Report security vulnerabilities privately
- Use proper input validation
- Implement appropriate error handling

### Getting Help

- **Documentation**: Start with our comprehensive docs
- **Issues**: Check existing issues and discussions
- **Code**: Reference existing implementations
- **Architecture**: See [ARCHITECTURE.md](Documentation/ARCHITECTURE.md)

### Recognition

Contributors will be recognized in:
- README.md contributors section
- Release notes for significant contributions
- Special recognition for accessibility improvements
