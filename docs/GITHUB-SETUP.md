# GitHub Setup Guide

This document provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the Othello iOS project on GitHub with full CI/CD integration.

## Repository Setup

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

```bash
# On GitHub.com:
# 1. Go to https://github.com/new
# 2. Repository name: othello-ios
# 3. Description: "Modern, accessible Othello game for iOS built with SwiftUI"
# 4. Set to Public (or Private if preferred)
# 5. DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
# 6. Click "Create repository"
```

### 2. Connect Local Repository

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/othello-ios.git

# Verify remote
git remote -v

# Push initial commit
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Configure Repository Settings

#### Branch Protection Rules
1. Go to **Settings â†’ Branches**
2. Click **Add rule** for `main` branch
3. Configure:

   - [x] Require status checks to pass before merging
   - [x] Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - [x] Require conversation resolution before merging
   - [x] Include administrators

#### Required Status Checks
Add these status checks (they'll appear after first CI run):
- `Test Suite / Test Suite`
- `Quality Gates / Quality Gates`

/OthelloApp/Models/ @YOUR_USERNAME

# CI/CD
/.github/ @YOUR_USERNAME
```

## Verification Checklist

After setup, verify:

- [ ] Repository is properly configured
- [ ] Branch protection rules are active
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs successfully
- [ ] Code coverage reporting works
- [ ] Issue templates are available
- [ ] PR template is configured
- [ ] Security scanning is enabled
- [ ] Dependabot is configured
- [ ] Release automation works

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CI fails on first run**
   - Check secrets are properly configured
   - Verify Swift version in workflow matches Xcode

2. **Code coverage not reporting**
   - Verify CODECOV_TOKEN is set
   - Check coverage file generation in CI logs

3. **Branch protection too strict**
   - Temporarily disable for initial setup
   - Re-enable after first successful CI run
